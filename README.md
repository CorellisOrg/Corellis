> **We run a 28-lobster AI team that handles ops, marketing, releases, and weekly reports. This is the system behind it.**

Turn one [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) assistant into a self-managing AI workforce — lobsters that coordinate tasks, learn from their mistakes, and get better every week.

**Production-tested since February 2026** · 28 lobsters · 50,000+ Slack messages indexed · 500+ self-corrections · single server

## A Real Example

Last month we tested fleet-wide goal coordination for the first time. The founder typed one message:

> *"Launch a user acquisition campaign for the new product line."*

Here's what happened over the next 2 hours — with zero human intervention after that single message:

1. **The controller** decomposed the goal into 6 sub-goals and created a milestone + 7 tracking cards on the task board
2. **6 lobsters were assigned** — marketing, engineering, payments, ops, partnerships, frontend — each in a dedicated thread
3. **All 6 confirmed** within minutes, following the goal-participant protocol: analyze scope → break into subtasks → define acceptance criteria
4. **Spontaneous cross-team coordination emerged** — the payments lobster and the partnerships lobster started aligning on API design in their thread (4 rounds of back-and-forth). The marketing lobster and the ops lobster resolved scope boundaries on their own
5. **One lobster independently created 5 subtask cards** with goal IDs, owners, dependencies, and deadlines — without being asked

**Result:** 36 task cards on the board — 1 milestone, 7 sub-goals, 28 self-created subtasks. Two cross-team interfaces aligned. All from one sentence.

## How It Works

Each team member gets their own AI assistant (a "lobster") running in a Docker container — with private memory and conversations. Behind the scenes, they share company knowledge and a searchable team memory.

## Key Capabilities

### 🧠 Teamind — Collective Team Memory
Every Slack conversation is indexed with embeddings. Any lobster can search *"what did we decide about the pricing model?"* and get accurate, sourced answers — across all channels, all history.

### 🧬 Self-Improving Lobsters
Lobsters detect when they're corrected, record the lesson, and permanently improve. Validated patterns promote fleet-wide — one lobster's mistake becomes every lobster's knowledge.

### 🎯 GoalOps — Goals, Not Instructions
Give your controller a high-level goal. It decomposes into sub-goals, assigns to lobsters, and they self-coordinate — with P2P handoffs, dependency tracking, and human-in-the-loop approval for sensitive actions.

### 📋 Task Management
Unified task board with sprint planning, breakdown, and tracking. Backend-agnostic: works with Notion, Linear, GitHub Projects, or plain markdown.

### 🐣 30-Second Spawning
Tell your controller *"spawn a lobster for alice"* — it creates the Slack app, handles OAuth, and launches the container. You click Allow and paste one token.

### 📦 17+ Built-in Skills
Deep research, SEO monitoring, landing page optimization, weekly reports, structured decision alignment, approval workflows, Excalidraw diagrams, data dashboards, and more. See [`templates/skills/`](templates/skills/).

### 🤖 Coding Agent Workflow
Confidence-based routing for ACP coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor). High confidence → auto-execute. Medium → structured prompt + review. Low → ask human first. Every change goes through automated tests + manual review before shipping.

### 🔍 Proactive Task Discovery
Lobsters don't just wait for assignments — a daily cron triggers them to scan task boards for unassigned work, score items by capability match, and propose actionable items to their owner. Self-driving by default.

### 🔄 Fleet Operations
Rolling upgrades with canary + auto-rollback. Config broadcasting. Health checks. Credential management. Gateway watchdogs. 24 operational scripts — all battle-tested.

## Get Started

**Prerequisites:** [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) on your host machine + Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CorellisOrg/corellis.git
cd corellis
cp .env.example .env           # add your LLM API key
docker compose up -d           # launch your first lobster
```

> **Note:** Each lobster needs a Slack bot app. Run `./scripts/create-slack-app.sh <name>` to create one automatically, or see [Slack Bot Setup](docs/slack-bot-setup.md) for manual setup.

## Production Evidence

This isn't a weekend project. Corellis has been running continuously since February 2026:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Fleet size | 28 lobsters on a single server (64GB RAM, 16 vCPU) |
| Teamind indexed | 50,000+ Slack messages across 30+ channels |
| Self-improving cycles | 500+ corrections detected and persisted |
| Goals executed | 200+ goals decomposed and coordinated |
| Skills deployed | 17+ fleet-wide + custom per-lobster skills |

The 24 operational scripts and Teamind modules were built iteratively from real production needs — not designed in a vacuum.

## Architecture

<details>
<summary>Controller on host + lobsters in Docker containers</summary>

The **controller** runs on the host (not in Docker) — it manages containers and writes to shared directories. Each **lobster** runs in an isolated Docker container with read-only access to shared knowledge.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Host Machine                                     │
│                                                   │
│  🎛️ Controller (OpenClaw on host)                 │
│  ├── Manages Docker containers                    │
│  ├── Writes company-skills/, company-memory/      │
│  └── Runs spawn, broadcast, sync, health-check    │
│                                                   │
│  ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐         │
│  │ 🦞 alice │ │ 🦞 bob   │ │ 🦞 carol │         │
│  │ (Docker) │ │ (Docker) │ │ (Docker) │         │
│  └────┬─────┘ └────┬─────┘ └────┬─────┘         │
│       │             │             │               │
│  ┌────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴────┐         │
│  │  Shared Volumes (bind mount, ro)    │         │
│  │  company-memory/ company-skills/    │         │
│  │  company-config/ shared-knowledge   │         │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────┘         │
│                                                   │
│  Each lobster also has private rw storage:        │
│  configs/<name>/workspace/ → ~/.openclaw/         │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why the controller isn't in Docker:** It needs to run `docker compose`, manage host files, and execute fleet scripts. Docker-in-Docker adds complexity with no benefit.

<details>
<summary>All 24 operational scripts</summary>

### Core Operations
| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `create-slack-app.sh` | Auto-create Slack App via Manifest API |
| `spawn-lobster.sh` | Create a new lobster container |
| `health-check.sh` | Check gateway, Slack, disk, memory for all lobsters |
| `rolling-upgrade.sh` | Upgrade image with canary testing and auto-rollback |

### Fleet Management
| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `apply-fleet-config.sh` | Deep-merge JSON patches into all lobster configs |
| `sync-fleet.sh` | Push skills, memory, and API keys to all lobsters |
| `broadcast.sh` | Send message via AI session (lobster reformulates) |
| `broadcast-direct.sh` | Send message via Slack API (100% reliable) |

### Maintenance
| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `config-watchdog.sh` | Dead-man switch: auto-rollback if not cancelled |
| `gateway-watchdog.sh` | Cron job: restart gateway if unhealthy |
| `enable-acp.sh` | Enable Claude Code/ACP on a specific lobster |
| `patch-all.sh` | Apply all OpenClaw patches (idempotent) |

</details>

<details>
<summary>Governance framework</summary>

Corellis includes a governance framework so your fleet operates as a coherent organization:

| Template | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Company-wide rules: session startup, memory management, correction detection, security |
| `REGISTRY.md` | Master index of all shared resources |
| `DIRECTORY.md` | Path/permission mapping for all shared directories |
| `PLAYBOOK-SPEC.md` | Standard format for operational playbooks |

Place them in `company-config/` on the host → bind-mounted read-only into every lobster → consistent behavior fleet-wide.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Secrets management</summary>

Each lobster gets two secret files:

- **`secrets.json`** (read-only) — Shared API keys injected at spawn time
- **`personal-secrets.json`** (read-write) — Per-lobster private credentials

OpenClaw's SecretRef system (`{"$ref": "secrets://KEY"}`) keeps secrets out of config files.

## Alternatives

| Approach | Corellis Difference |
|----------|-------------------|
| **CrewAI / AutoGen** | They orchestrate tasks. Corellis orchestrates an **organization** — persistent lobsters with memory, identity, and relationships |
| **ChatDev / MetaGPT** | Code-generation focused. Corellis is **general-purpose**: ops, marketing, research, finance, anything |
| **Multiple separate assistants** | No coordination. Corellis adds **shared knowledge, Teamind, fleet learning, and GoalOps** |
| **Enterprise AI platforms** (Glean, Moveworks) | SaaS, closed-source. Corellis is **self-hosted, MIT licensed, fully customizable** |

## Requirements

- [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) on the host machine
- Docker + Docker Compose
- Slack workspace with bot apps (one per lobster)
- 2GB RAM per lobster (3GB with Claude Code)
